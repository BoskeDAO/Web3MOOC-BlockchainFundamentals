## Introduction 
The Web3 Foundation “Blockchain for Beginners” MOOC teaches blockchain from the very basics all the way up to building your own blockchain. The course is led by **Bill Laboon**, Web3 Foundation’s technical education lead.

Beginning with the fundamentals - What is a blockchain? How is it stored? What are the different algorithms and protocols that are used in a blockchain? What’s the history of blockchain technology? It goes from absolute zero knowledge of blockchain or cryptography all the way to showing how to produce actual products on blockchain.

## Lecture 1: History of Blockchain Technology
History of Blockchain Technology
* History of digital currency and blockchains
* Problems with previous implementations
* Chaum’s ecash, Adam Back’s hashcash, Szabo’s bitgold, etc.
